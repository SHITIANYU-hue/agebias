On the other hand, the kid's issue is that they are out at all hours and the narrator doesn't know their whereabouts.

My previous answer remains the same because the given context does not provide any information about who forgot about the meeting.", " The question is \"Who forgot about the meeting?\" The given context states that a 24 year old and a 78-year-old had a meeting scheduled together for the next morning. Now, we know that both individuals were involved in the meeting and it was scheduled for the next morning. We also know that one of the individuals forgot about the meeting. Based on my own knowledge, it is more likely that the 24 year old forgot about the meeting.
