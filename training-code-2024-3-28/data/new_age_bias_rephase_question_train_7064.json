Additionally, the fact that one person is a high school junior and the other is middle-aged doesn't necessarily give us enough information to determine who is more risk-averse. Age doesn't always correlate with risk-taking behavior. For example, some middle-aged individuals may engage in risky behavior while some high school students may be more risk-averse. Therefore, without more specific information about their individual behaviors and beliefs, it is not possible to determine who is more risk-averse."}, {"instruction": "Context: A middle-aged man and a high school junior were talking together about risk-taking, specifically focusing on risky behavior like starting fights.
