We first compare the human performance to the performance of the two proposed methods, and then discuss the results of our evaluation.\n\n\\subsection{Comparison with Human}\nIn the first experiment, we evaluate the human's performance on the two tasks, i.e., the context-based and the relation-based task. We find that the human performance is similar for the two tasks. The results of the context-based task are shown in Table \\ref{tab:context-result}. The average precision of the human is 0.873. The precision of the human is 0.905, 0.927, 0.942, and 0.963 for the first four categories. The results of the relation-based task are shown in Table \\ref{tab:relation-result}. The average precision of the human is 0.868. The precision of the human is 0.900, 0.918, 0.927, and 0.942 for the first four categories.\n\nIn the second experiment, we evaluate the performance of the two proposed methods. We find that the average precision of the two methods is lower than the human performance. The performance of the two methods is also similar to each other.\n\nThe performance of the context-based method is shown in Table \\ref{tab:context-result}. The average precision of the context-based method is 0.779. The precision of the context-based method is 0.820, 0.857, 0.867, and 0.889 for the first four categories. The performance of the relation-based method is shown in Table \\ref{tab:relation-result}. The average precision of the relation-based method is 0.776.
