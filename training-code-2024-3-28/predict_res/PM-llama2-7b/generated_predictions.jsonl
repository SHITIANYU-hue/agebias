{"label": "Yes,  The context tells us that the person speaking gets frustrated with her son and grandfather. However, she mentions specific reasons for each of them. She says that her grandfather is out at all hours and she doesn't know where he is, implying that he has a good memory to remember where he's going. On the other hand, she says her son can't seem to keep track of what they talked about just five minutes ago, indicating that he doesn't have a good memory. Therefore, we can infer that her grandfather probably has an okay memory compared to her son. This is because her grandfather is able to remember his whereabouts, while her son struggles to remember recent conversations.
