However, the situation seems to have caused some discomfort for one of them when it comes to using a phone. Based on the context, it can be inferred that the grandfather was not comfortable using the phone to book the cab on Uber. This conclusion can be drawn from the fact that the grandson was also present and was not mentioned to have any difficulty using the phone, implying that the issue was with the grandfather. Therefore, it can be concluded that the grandfather was not comfortable using the phone.',\n",

We know that the grandson was struggling with the app and not listening to the advice from his grandfather. Based on this information, we can conclude that it was the grandfather who was not comfortable using the phone. This is because the grandson was the one struggling with the app and not following the grandfather's advice, indicating that the grandfather was more familiar with using the phone and the app. Therefore, the main idea of the previous answer remains the same, but it is rephrased to better reflect the context and conclusion.\",\n",
       " ' The grandson and his grandfather were seen outside Walmart trying to book a cab on Uber. From this, we can infer that the grandson was teaching the grandfather how to use the phone and the Uber app. Therefore, the grandfather was giving the grandson the opportunity to learn how to use the phone and book a cab on Uber. This shows that age is not a barrier when it comes to learning new technology, and it is heartwarming to see a grandparent and grandchild bond over a common interest.',\n",

In this situation, it is clear that the grandfather was giving the grandson the opportunity to learn how to use the phone and the app. Despite the grandson not paying much attention to his grandfather's advice, the grandfather was still patiently trying to teach him.

Based on this information, it can be concluded that the grandmother was the one who was not comfortable using the phone.

Therefore, it is safe to say that the grandmother was the one who was not comfortable using the phone in this situation.',\n",

This conclusion is based on the fact that the grandson was struggling with the app and not listening to the grandmother's advice, indicating that she may have been more familiar with using technology and the app.\",\n",

It can be inferred that the grandmother was giving the grandson the opportunity to learn how to use the phone. This suggests that the grandmother is technologically savvy and was willing to pass on her knowledge to the grandson. This could also imply a close relationship between the two, where the grandmother is playing a nurturing role in the grandson's life.\",\n",

The grandfather seemed uncomfortable using the phone, possibly due to unfamiliarity with technology. This observation leads me to conclude that the grandfather was not comfortable using the phone to book a cab on Uber. This could be due to a generational gap or lack of experience with using smartphone apps. Regardless, it was clear that the granddaughter was more at ease using the phone technology.',\n",
