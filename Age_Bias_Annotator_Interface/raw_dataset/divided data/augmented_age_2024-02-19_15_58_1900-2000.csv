The middle school student, despite being younger and possibly more tech-savvy, still found it enjoyable to adapt to the newest gadget.

On the other hand, the retiree, who is older and may not have been exposed to as much technology, may find it more challenging to keep up with the latest advancements. The fact that the middle school student enjoyed adapting to the newest gadget suggests that they are more open and eager to learn about new technology, while the retiree found the whole process too exhausting and gave up, indicating that they may not be as up to date with modern times.
