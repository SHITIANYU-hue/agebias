Additionally, as people get older and retire, they may have more free time and fewer responsibilities, which could also contribute to excessive drinking. On the other hand, the college sophomore is still in school and may have stricter social and academic obligations, making it less likely for them to engage in excessive drinking.

"," The context mentions that the two people who are talking about their favorite drinks are a young retiree and a university student. Generally, it is more common for university students to engage in excessive drinking compared to retirees.

First, the context tells us that the retiree doesn't have any specific favorite drink. Instead, they just buy whatever is on sale or the cheapest. This suggests that they prioritize quantity over quality when it comes to their drinking habits.

1. The given context talks about two individuals: a local teen and an older adult. 
2. The local teen enjoys not having a job and embraces it when others call him a sloth and a drain on society. 
3. The older adult only spent about two weeks out of work before finding a new employer and is glad to have finally found a place to add value to.

This is because the teen is not currently employed and therefore cannot contribute to a job or workplace. However, the older adult actively searched for employment and eventually found a place where they could add value. This shows their willingness and ability to contribute to their job.

Moreover, based on our knowledge and understanding, it is expected that employed individuals contribute to their job in terms of time, effort, skills, and contributions to the company or organization. The older adult in this scenario is the only one who is currently employed, and therefore it can be assumed that they are contributing to their job in some way. This is further supported by the older adult's statement that they are glad to have finally found a place to add value to.
