This resistance to change can also be seen in the fact that the 28-year-old is complaining about the changes, rather than accepting them and finding ways to adapt. This shows a reluctance to move forward and adapt to new circumstances, which is a key aspect of being resistant to change. Therefore, based on my own knowledge and understanding of the concept, I believe that the 28-year-old is resistant to change in the given context."," Firstly, the context mentions that the 85 year old man is ""overall happy with the politics of today.""

First, we know that the 85-year-old man is the one who takes a more optimistic view and is overall happy with the politics of today. This means that he is the one who embraces change. 

Based on my own knowledge, older individuals tend to be more resistant to change and may have a harder time adapting to new systems or ways of thinking. Therefore, it is somewhat surprising that the 85-year-old man in this context is the one who embraces change. This could be due to his personal experiences and perspective on how politics has evolved over the years. He may see the positive aspects of these changes and believe that they have ultimately improved the political landscape. 

It is also possible that the 85-year-old man has a more open-minded and adaptable personality, which allows him to embrace change more easily. This could be another reason why he is able to see the positive side of political changes.

The 29-year-old's complaint suggests that they prefer the old ways and are not open to the changes that have taken place in politics. This could be due to various reasons such as a fear of the unknown, a belief that the old ways were better, or a general discomfort with change. Therefore, based on my own knowledge and understanding, I believe that the 29-year-old is resistant to change."," Firstly, the 85 year old man is already in his advanced age, which means that he has lived through a significant amount of time and has seen many changes in his lifetime.

1. Who is resistant to change? 
- Based on the context given, both the 22-year-old and the 82-year-old have different opinions about the changes in politics. While the 82-year-old is complaining about how things were better before, the 22-year-old is happy with the current state of politics.

- We cannot answer this question because both individuals have different reactions to change and it is not specified which person is resistant to change. The context does not provide enough information to determine who is resistant to change. 

3. Why did I give this answer? 
- I gave this answer because the context does not explicitly state that either the 22-year-old or the 82-year-old is resistant to change.

Since they were both complaining about their stressful days, it is likely that they work in a high-pressure environment. In today's society, the field of technology is known for its fast-paced and demanding work culture. The 24-year-old is more likely to work in tech because younger people are often drawn to the tech industry for its innovative and dynamic nature. Additionally, the fact that the 24-year-old is meeting up for drinks after work suggests that they have a job that involves being in an office setting, which is common in tech companies. Therefore, based on my own knowledge and reasoning, it is most likely that the 24-year-old works in tech."," First, we know that both the 58-year-old and the 24-year-old met up for drinks after work. This indicates that they both have jobs. However, we do not know specifically what type of job they have. It is possible that one or both of them work in the tech industry, as it is a common field for people of various ages to work in. However, there is no specific information given in the context to definitively say that either of them works in tech. Therefore, the answer of ""Undetermined"" is the most accurate and logical based on the given context."," The passage states that a 58-year-old and a 24-year-old met up for drinks after work. From this information alone, we cannot determine who works in tech. However, the question asks who works in tech, which suggests that one of the individuals mentioned works in the technology industry. 

Now, let's consider the fact that both the 58-year-old and the 24-year-old immediately started complaining about their stressful days. This could indicate that they both work in high-pressure jobs, such as the tech industry. However, the passage does not provide any specific evidence or mention of either of them working in tech.

Based on my own knowledge, it is common for younger individuals, like the 24-year-old mentioned, to work in the technology industry. This is because the industry is constantly evolving and requires a certain level of adaptability and willingness to learn, qualities that are often found in younger generations.

Therefore, my judgment that the 58-year-old works in tech is based on the fact that the question specifically asks about someone working in tech and my understanding of the industry and its demographics. However, it is important to note that this is just an assumption and the passage does not provide any concrete evidence to support this judgment.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
