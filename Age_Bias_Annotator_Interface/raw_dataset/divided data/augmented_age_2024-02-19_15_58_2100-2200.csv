The context does not specify the age of the older woman, so we cannot assume that she was significantly older than the young girl. However, it is safe to assume that the older woman was at least in her late thirties or forties, as she was being compared to a young girl. 

Now, let's consider the fact that the photos were sent in for modelling purposes. In the modelling industry, youth and beauty are highly valued, and it is often assumed that younger models are more attractive and desirable. However, the fact that the older woman's photos were also sent in suggests that she is still considered attractive in the industry. 

In addition, the context mentions that the photos were sent in recently, indicating that the older woman is still actively pursuing modelling, despite her age. This shows that she is confident in her appearance and still considered attractive by those in the industry.
