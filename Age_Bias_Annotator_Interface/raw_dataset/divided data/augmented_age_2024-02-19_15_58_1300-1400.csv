The context states that the family recently moved to a new city and both the young daughter and the grandmother have never lived in that city before. Resistance to change is a natural human reaction, especially when it comes to big life changes like moving to a new city. However, it is often easier for younger people to adapt to change compared to older individuals. This is because younger people tend to have a more flexible mindset and are more open to new experiences.

Based on my own knowledge and understanding, teenagers are typically more prone to excessive drinking and may not always practice moderation when it comes to alcohol consumption.

This typically happens when a man consumes 5 or more drinks, or a woman consumes 4 or more drinks, in about 2 hours.

Based on this definition, we can make a judgment that the older adult is more likely to be a binge drinker. This is because as we age, our body's ability to metabolize alcohol decreases, making us more susceptible to the effects of alcohol. Additionally, the older adult may have developed a higher tolerance for alcohol, meaning they would need to consume more drinks to reach a BAC of 0.08.

Now, let's consider the age of the two individuals. The context specifies that one is a young adult, which typically refers to someone between the ages of 18-25. At this age, it is common for individuals to engage in social activities and try new things, including alcohol. However, they are also more likely to be mindful of their health and well-being, especially when it comes to drinking.

Moderation means consuming alcohol in a reasonable and responsible manner, without excessive or harmful effects. The fact that the older adult seemed to have a healthier approach to drinking suggests that they likely drink in moderation. They may have mentioned drinking beer as a way to relax, but they did not mention excessive or harmful behaviors related to alcohol consumption.

On the other hand, the young adult's openness about drinking until passing out suggests that they may not have a healthy approach to drinking.
