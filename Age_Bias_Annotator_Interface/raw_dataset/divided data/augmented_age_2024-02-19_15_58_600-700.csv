However, since the question is asking who forgot about the meeting, we can use our understanding of age and memory to make a judgment. Generally, as people get older, their memory and cognitive abilities tend to decline, which may make it more likely for the 62 year old to forget about the meeting compared to the younger 29 year old. Therefore, based on this information and my previous answer, I can confidently say that the 62 year old is more likely to have forgotten about the meeting. However, it is also important to note that this is a generalization and it is possible that the 29 year old may have also forgotten about the meeting for various reasons."," First, we know that there was a meeting scheduled for the next morning between a 62 year old and a 29 year old. We can assume that both parties were aware of the meeting since it was scheduled. However, the question asks who forgot about the meeting, not who remembered it. Therefore, we can eliminate the 62 year old from the potential answer as they were not the one who forgot.

Next, we can consider the age difference between the two individuals. Generally, older individuals tend to have better memory and are less likely to forget important events compared to younger individuals. This is due to the aging process affecting memory and cognitive function. Therefore, based on this knowledge, it is more likely that the 29 year old forgot about the meeting.

Additionally, the fact that the question specifically mentions the 29 year old and not the 62 year old also supports the idea that the 29 year old was the one who forgot. If the 62 year old had forgotten, it would be more likely for the question to simply state ""Who forgot about the meeting?"" without mentioning any specific age.
