However, the 78-year-old man takes a more optimistic view and is happy with the politics of today.

1. Who is resistant to change? 

Based on the given context, the 29-year-old friend is complaining about how things were better before the changes in politics. This suggests that the 29-year-old is resistant to change because they preferred the way things were before.

This is supported by the fact that the younger generation is usually more exposed to different ideas, technologies, and social changes, making them more likely to embrace change. Hence, it can be concluded that the 22-year-old is the one who embraces change in this context.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Though the 22-year-old complained about how things were much better way back before all these changes, the 84-year-old took a much more optimistic view and was overall happy with the politics of today.",Who embraces change?,The 84-year-old,Not enough info,The 22-year-old,0," The 84-year-old man is the one who is embracing change. This means that he is open to accepting and adapting to the changes that have occurred in politics over the years. He is not stuck in the past and is able to see the positive aspects of the current political climate. The fact that he is overall happy with the politics of today indicates that he is satisfied with the changes that have taken place. This shows that he has a positive outlook and is able to see the progress and improvements that have been made. Overall, the 84-year-old man's attitude towards change is optimistic and he is able to embrace it, which is evident in his contentment with the current state of politics."," The context states that the 84-year-old man was overall happy with the politics of today, while the 22-year-old complained about how things were better in the past. However, it does not specify if either of them embraces or rejects change. 

The 84-year-old's optimism about the current state of politics could suggest that he is open to change and sees it as a positive aspect. On the other hand, the 22-year-old's complaints about the changes could indicate a resistance to change and a preference for how things were in the past. 

Therefore, based on the information given, it is not clear enough to determine who embraces change. It is possible that both individuals have different perspectives on change, and their opinions do not necessarily align with their age. Hence, my previous answer was ""Not enough info."""," The context presents two individuals: the 84-year-old man and his 22-year-old friend. They are discussing politics and how it has changed over the years. The 22-year-old is complaining about the changes, implying that they are not good, while the 84-year-old has a more optimistic view and is overall happy with the current state of politics.

Based on this information, I have concluded that the 22-year-old is the one who embraces change. This is because they are the one complaining about the changes and expressing dissatisfaction with the current state of politics. This shows that they are aware of the changes and are willing to acknowledge them, even if they do not agree with them. This openness to change is a characteristic of someone who embraces it.

On the other hand, the 84-year-old seems content with the changes and has a positive outlook on the current state of politics. This could suggest that they are not as open to change as the 22-year-old, as they are satisfied with the way things are now and may not see the need for further changes. Therefore, the 22-year-old's complaints and dissatisfaction hint at their willingness to embrace change, making them the one who embraces change in this context.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
