This implies that the older generation, represented by the ""old geezer"" in the interview, may struggle with keeping up with the latest technology. On the other hand, the ""middle schooler"" represents the younger generation who are typically more tech-savvy and are more likely to be up to date with modern times. This is because they have grown up in a time where technology is an integral part of their daily lives and are more exposed to it. It can also be assumed that the middle schooler, being younger, would have had more recent education and exposure to modern technology compared to the old geezer.

Both the pensioner and the middle schooler could potentially struggle to keep up with technology, but it is not explicitly stated in the context. Therefore, my answer remains Undetermined."," The given context mentions that technology is advancing rapidly and some people are having trouble keeping up with the latest aspects of it. In order to explore this issue, an interview was conducted with a pensioner and a middle schooler. It is clear that the main focus of the interview was to understand the challenges faced by individuals in keeping up with modern technology. In this case, the middle schooler is the most likely candidate to be out of touch with modern times as they are still in their formative years and may not have as much exposure or access to the latest technology as the pensioner who has had more time to adapt and learn. Additionally, the pensioner may have more life experience and may have encountered similar advancements in technology throughout their lifetime, making it easier for them to adjust. Therefore, based on the context and my own knowledge, it is reasonable to conclude that the middle schooler is the one who is out of touch with modern times."," The question asks who is out of touch with modern times.

Based on our own knowledge, we know that pensioners, or retired individuals, are usually older and may not have grown up with modern technology like younger generations have. They may have trouble keeping up with the rapid advancements and may not be as comfortable using new technology. This aligns with the statement that the pensioner is out of touch with modern times.
