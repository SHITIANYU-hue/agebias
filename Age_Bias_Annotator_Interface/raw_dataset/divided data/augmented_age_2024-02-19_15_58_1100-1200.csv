In this situation, the parent would want to make sure that the person driving their car is responsible and not reckless.

Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the elderly father would not be reckless if given the car, making the kid the one who was not reckless in this scenario.

The fact that the parent is considering their options shows that they are responsible and mindful of the potential risks involved in loaning their car.

Now, let's look at the two potential options: the elderly father and the kid. It is highly unlikely that the elderly father would be reckless with the car. Elderly people are generally more cautious and careful, especially when it comes to driving. They have years of experience and are more aware of their limitations. Moreover, in the context, the parent is considering loaning the car to either the elderly father or the kid for the day. This suggests that the parent trusts both individuals, further indicating that the elderly father is not reckless.

On the other hand, the kid, who is likely younger and less experienced in driving, may be more prone to recklessness. Younger individuals tend to have a higher risk-taking behavior, and this can apply to driving as well. They may be more likely to speed, ignore traffic rules, or take unnecessary risks while behind the wheel. This could potentially lead to accidents or other reckless behavior.

In this scenario, the parent had to choose between loaning their car to their elderly parent or their daughter. The fact that the daughter had previously been caught drinking and driving suggests that she has a history of reckless behavior. Drinking and driving is not only illegal but also extremely dangerous, as it puts not only the driver but also others on the road at risk. Therefore, the daughter's previous actions of drinking and driving can be considered reckless.

Next, we are told that one of the organizers was not forgetful. This means that the other organizer must have been forgetful.
