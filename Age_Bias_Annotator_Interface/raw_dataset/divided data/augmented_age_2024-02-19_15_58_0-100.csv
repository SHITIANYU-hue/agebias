This suggests that the grandson was likely younger and therefore may not have been able to walk quickly. Additionally, the fact that the grandmother was with the grandson suggests that she was likely accompanying and helping him. 

Moreover, the context mentions that the speaker dropped them off at home, which implies that they were carrying groceries. It is more likely that the grandson was carrying the groceries, as it would be difficult for the grandmother to carry them while also supporting the grandson. 

Finally, the context mentions that the two were plodding, which suggests a slow and steady pace. This further supports the idea that the grandson was setting the pace, as the grandmother may have been following his lead.

Based on this reasoning, it is likely that the grandson was carrying the groceries and setting the pace between the two.
