This indicates that they were both involved in the process of learning how to use the phone. However, based on my own knowledge and experience, I believe that the grandson was the one giving the opportunity to learn how to use the phone to the grandfather. This is because younger generations are often more tech-savvy and familiar with using smartphones and apps like Uber. Additionally, it is common for grandchildren to help their grandparents with technology-related tasks. Therefore, it is likely that the grandson took the lead in teaching and guiding the grandfather through the process of booking a cab on Uber.
